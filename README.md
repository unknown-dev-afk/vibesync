### Hi, I'm Unknown-Dev-Afk! 💖🌸

Welcome to my world of code, vibes, and creativity.

- 🔭 I’m building [VibeSync](https://unknown-dev-afk.github.io/vibesync): an anime-themed chat + music app!
- 🌱 I’m learning frontend, Firebase, and how to vibe harder.
- 💬 Ask me about building fun things with HTML, JS, and glitter.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I named my AI dev “pookie” and it stuck.
